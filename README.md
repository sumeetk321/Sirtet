# Sirtet
A version of the classic game "Tetris" where blocks are cleared by matching colors together, rather than line by line. "Chunks" will only be cleared if they consist of 10 or more 1x1 blocks.

Music: All Star but it's the Tetris Theme Song (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2DJn4XUE5A).

Made by Ryan Yoon, Sumeet Kulkarni, and Madeline Choi.
